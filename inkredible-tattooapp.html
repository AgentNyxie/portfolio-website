  <h1>Tattoo App (Inkredible)</h1>
  <p>“How might we make it easier for people to find the perfect tattoo artist?” This webapp design involved every step of the UX process, from research and ideation, to prototyping and iterating, and finally producing a high-fidelity design for both desktop and mobile devices.</p>

  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>Many people decide to get a tattoo each year, but one complaint always seems to come up: it’s hard to find a good artist without a lot of effort. My webapp concept, Inkredible, aims to simplify the process by putting the right information in front of users at the right time. As the sole person working on this project, I performed research and developed a solution, tested it on potential users, and created high-fidelity deliverables.</p>

  <h3>Empathize & Define</h3>

  <p>For this project, I did initial research into the problem space, starting with user interviews. Over a hundred key quotes across five in-depth users yielded 21 key insights. In some cases, these made me shift my strategy for the app. For example, I had planned to let graphic designers create tattoos for users, and let artists apply the finished design, but multiple comments like those in the image below led me to kill the idea. The need for users to collaborate with a single artist on both the design and application was hard to ignore.</p>
  <p>This research also helped me to identify pain points for specific user types. Beginners struggled with a lack of knowledge about how to get a tattoo in the first place, while veteran enthusiasts said they hated meeting an artist for the first time only to find out their personalities didn’t mesh - and what’s worse, they felt pressure to get whatever design the artist created, even if it wasn’t something they really liked. Both groups mentioned that it’s not easy to tell from most websites if you’ll like an artist, since neither Instagram nor listing services provides a good idea of an artist’s personality, specialties, or work style. SWOT analysis on other tattoo apps showed they weren’t taking steps to address these issues.</p>

  </picture>

  <p>Based on the above pain points, I created my first personas: Cassie and Angie. Their goal is the same - to get a tattoo - but their needs are different. Cassie has wanted a tattoo, but never gotten one, so she needs some guidance in the process. Meanwhile, Angie has multiple tattoos and ideas for even more, but she struggles sometimes to find an artist who can perfectly match her style and personality.</p>
  <p>I found that sticking to two proto personas to start greatly simplified planning and kept me from adding features that wouldn’t benefit most users. It also helped me distill a complex array of beliefs and pain points found during affinity mapping into crystal clear personas. Next, I created a problem statement that addressed both users.</p>

  </picture>

  <p>To wrap up this phase of the project, I created a Business Requirements Document including core app features. For instance, my research showed that users searched for artists on multiple devices, so it made sense to build a webapp. I also started to identify and think through competitive risks and opportunities for the app, plus business requirements, objectives, the scope of work, product requirements, the development schedule, and deliverables. In a real-world setting, I would want to get insights from and collaborate with other teams to nail down some of these important details.</p>

  <h3>Ideate</h3>

  <p>With my initial planning done, I began creating user journey maps to think through how Cassie and Angie would move through the webapp. Where would the navigation bar sit? What kinds of actions would users need to complete, and where would it make sense to put the tools they need to complete those actions? These questions and more helped me think about what info users would find relevant and when to share it. It also helped me understand how features might change in adapting mobile designs to desktop.</p>

  </picture>

  <p>Along with research found in my interviews, my user journey maps helped me identify the core features that my webapp would need to include.</p>
  <p>For starters, tattoo enthusiasts wanted the ability to ask other people for recommendations and advice, so I decided to add a home screen where users can share tattoo ideas and ask for recommendations. This would help Cassie ease into the world of tattoos, and show Angie artists who might be able to give her that awesome tattoo she’s been thinking about getting.</p>
  <p>Users also said they wanted to search with artists and get to know them and their work before meeting up, so I included a robust search function as a core feature, as well as profiles that let artists show more of their personality.</p>
  <p>Finally, once Cassie and Angie get to know an artist, they may want to reach out with questions, so I included a chat feature as well.</p>

  </picture>

  <p>With these key features in mind, I began to develop the information architecture of the site with a sitemap. Since my webapp would have dynamically loaded content versus a lot of specific pages, and since most apps feature flat navigation, I chose a combination of strict and co-existing hierarchy. At this point, I also began creating wireframes which gradually improved in visual fidelity over time.</p>

  </picture>

  <h3>Prototype & Test</h3>

  <p>It was important at this point to make sure my design didn’t just look pretty, but actually worked! Getting feedback on a design early is important, so with my mid-fidelity wireframes on hand, I put together an interactive prototype in Adobe XD to rapidly test my design with potential users.</p>

    <img src="img\thumbnails\inkredible1200px\Inkredible-Mid-FiWireframes.jpg" alt="Inkredible - Mid-Fi Wireframes">
  </picture>

  <p>This involved creating a test plan, reaching out to users, creating test scripts, conducting the test itself, and finally sharing findings in an insights document.</p>
  <picture>
    <source srcset="img\thumbnails\inkredible600px\Inkredible-UserTestingQuotes.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
    <img src="img\thumbnails\inkredible1200px\Inkredible-UserTestingQuotes.jpg" alt="Inkredible - User Testing Quotes">
  </picture>

  <p>The test validated the overall design and yielded valuable feedback on how to improve it, including a simplified site structure, instant search (like Google), and a single menu with all user-related items. With these changes, Cassie and Angie can find artists they like more quickly, and navigate through the app more intuitively.</p>
  <p>Users also preferred a darker color scheme, which they associated with tattoo ink and the soothing ambience of a tattoo parlor. While my final design reflects this, in hindsight I would start with a light theme, which makes it easier to incorporate accessibility features and branding elements, and then add a dark theme later.</p>
  <p>With testing complete, I focused on improving the overall visual design using Gestalt principles and visual hierarchy, which led to the use of cards to better sort search results. This was followed by a final round of feedback from fellow students, who recommended some tweaks to the user interface and the addition of best practices for dark themes.</p>

  <h3>Finalize & Look Forward</h3>

  <p>At this stage, I also worked on finalizing the desktop version of the webapp. While I had iterated on these in tandem with low- and mid-fidelity versions, the desktop versions saw the most changes during this phase. Throughout the design process, I tried to think of the kinds of affordances mouse and keyboard would allow versus smartphones and tablets.</p>

    <img src="img\thumbnails\inkredible1200px\Inkredible-DesktopWireframes.jpg" alt="Inkredible - Desktop Wireframes">
  </picture>

  <p>The next step was to look at any key functionality and think through how to make it more accessible to people who are differently abled. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines were tremendously helpful in this process, and served as a great foundation for several improvements.</p>

    <img src="img\thumbnails\inkredible1200px\Inkredible-AccessibilityImprovements.jpg" alt="Inkredible - Accessibility Improvements">
  </picture>

  <p>With these changes added, and with the look and essential functionality of the app largely finished, I built a style guide as well as the first draft of a proper design language system. This not only helped me solidify the visual identity of my design, but gave me valuable practice for handing design documents off to developers in the future.</p>

    <img src="img\thumbnails\inkredible1200px\Inkredible-DLS.jpg" alt="Inkredible - DLS">
  </picture>

  <p>In a real-world setting, I would want to collaborate early with marketing teams, development teams, and leadership to keep them on the same page. After handing off the initial design, I would also want to start mapping out additional ideas for features that could provide even more value to users and further set the app apart from its competitors.</p>

  <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

  <p>One of the big takeaways: when projects have longer development schedules, it’s important to look back and review past insights regularly. It’s very easy to forget key findings when you’re in the hustle and bustle of UX development, as I nearly did when I was working on this project. Reviewing your user research and earlier work helps you stay connected to important discoveries, so you won’t miss out on something that could really set your product apart from other apps and delight your users.</p>

    <img src="img\thumbnails\inkredible1200px\Inkredible-LessonKeepDocsHandy.jpg" alt="Inkredible - Lesson Learned Keep Docs Handy">
  </picture>

  <p>In addition, I realized that being able to complete the entire UX design process is rare in the real world, where external factors can change things in an instant. While it was good to go through each part of the process, it was also useful to think through where I might have to cut less important parts to meet deadlines - for example, testing on fewer users, saving some app features for after an MVP is released, and so on.</p>
